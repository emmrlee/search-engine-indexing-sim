Process files from https://www.cs.brynmawr.edu/cs337/Lab04Data/ into an inverted index
  - maps each word found in each of the files to a list of its instances/location
  - each instance of the word has a filename and line number associated with it

Tests searching the inverted index for (2) given keywords

Ranks the queried files by the minimum distance between the 2 given keywords

Program aims to serve as a testing playground to explore + examine rudimentary search engine indexing

Includes an [informal report](https://github.com/emmrlee/search-engine-indexing-sim/blob/main/Search%20Engines%20Decoded%20-Inverted%20Indexing%2C%20Relevancy%2C%20and%20Ranking.pdf) exploring search engine indexing concepts at a basic level.
